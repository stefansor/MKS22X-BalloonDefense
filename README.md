Balloon Tower Defense

5/19/2019
  Vivien: I created the abstract class Balloon. Then, I started working on RegularBalloons. I was looking into how to move the balloons based on the color of the pixel in front of it, but found that I could only use get() with PImages. From what I found, I cannot check background/object color so I decided to determine when a balloon should turn based of location. Because the balloon's movement depends on location, I only made some general movements because I need to match the movements to a the map.
