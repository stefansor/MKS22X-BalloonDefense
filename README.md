Balloon Tower Defense

5/19/2019
  Vivien: I created the abstract class Balloon. Then, I started working on RegularBalloons. I was looking into how to move the balloons based on the color of the pixel in front of it, but found that I could only use get() with PImages. From what I found, I cannot check background/object color so I decided to determine when a balloon should turn based of location. Because the balloon's movement depends on location, I only made some general movements because I need to match the movements to a the map.

  Vivien: During class, Stefan and I (at Mr. K's suggestion) decided to change the map into a collection of tiles that have directions to make balloon movement easier. We talked more about the design and began to code. I focused on spawning the balloons so that they are appropriately spaced and moving in a general pattern. I also got the framework for move using the tiles. However, I wasn't able to complete move because we need to complete the tile design and write another method that allows the balloon to determine which tile it is on. Once we complete the map and move, we can move onto tack and finish our basic version.
